### Pull Requests

If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to describe the issue and 
mention the issue number in the pull request description. 
This will make sure a link back to the original issue is created.

### Filing Issues/Bugs

I use Github issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to open an issue if you have 
found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented. Verify that your issue is not being currently 
addressed by other issues or pull requests.
