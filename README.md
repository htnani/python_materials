# Python Materials and Tutorials

![alt text](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png "Python Logo")

This repository is a collection of Python materials and tutorials that I found useful while learning and teaching Python. The goal of this repo is not only to store useful things for myself but also to help others who want to learn Python. That said I highly encourage you to participate in this repo and discuss content or add new materials. However, this repo will not contain any detailed explainations, it rather is a place where you can find links to other resources. There are so many awesome Python related materials out there that it would be a shame to not appreciate the work done and to do it all over again.

If you want to participate, please read the [contribution instructions](https://github.com/schmelling/python_materials/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first and keep the [code of conduct](https://github.com/schmelling/python_materials/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in mind when discussing problems.
